Velite is a lightweight, file-based content layer built on top of Zod, designed to replace complex solutions like Contentlayer (now discontinued). It turns Markdown/MDX into strongly-typed JSON data.

Why use it?

Type Safety: Uses Zod schemas to validate and type content structure (e.g., ensuring a `slug` is always a `string`).

Simple Setup: Define your content schemas in `velite.config.js` and run the CLI.

Agnostic: Works great with Next.js, Astro, or any React framework.

```js
// velite.config.js snippet
defineCollection({
  name: "Post",
  schema: s.object({
    slug: s.slug(),
    title: s.string().max(99),
    content: s.mdx(),
  }),
});
```
