When running `next export` or using the static output `(output: 'export')`, the built-in Next.js Image Component often results in blurry images due to missing image optimization features that rely on a server.

The Fix (Workaround):

Set the `unoptimized` prop to `true` on the `<Image />` component.
This bypasses the Next.js optimization logic entirely, ensuring the image is served directly as provided in the `public` directory, and is sharp.

```js
import Image from "next/image";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/images/static-hero.jpg"
      alt="Hero"
      width={800}
      height={600}
      unoptimized={true} // <-- The key fix for static exports
    />
  );
}
```
