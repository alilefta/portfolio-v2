## The Challenge: Analog Chaos in a Digital Industry

Dental Laboratories operate at the intersection of healthcare and manufacturing. A single prosthetic case (like a crown or bridge) moves through 5-10 distinct production stages, involves multiple technicians, and requires precise financial tracking.

Most labs still rely on paper tickets and spreadsheets. This leads to:

1.  **Lost Cases:** Physical trays getting misplaced in the lab.
2.  **Financial Leakage:** Unbilled work or miscalculated technician commissions.
3.  **Lack of Insight:** Lab owners have no real-time data on monthly revenue or debts.

I built **Oscar** to replace this analog chaos with a rigid, state-driven digital workflow.

## System Architecture

Since dental labs often operate in environments with unstable internet or require direct hardware integration (printers/scanners), a **Desktop-First** approach was chosen over a web app.

### Core Stack Decisions

- **Framework:** C# / WPF (.NET 8) for maximum performance and native OS integration.
- **Data Layer:** SQLite with Entity Framework Core. This provides a zero-configuration database that lives locally on the client's machine, ensuring data ownership and speed.
- **UI Library:** WPF UI (Modern Fluent Design) to break away from the "gray enterprise software" stereotype.

## Key Modules

### 1. State-Machine Case Tracking

The heart of Oscar is the Case Manager. It treats every dental order as a state machine.

- **States:** `Order Received` $\rightarrow$ `Designing` $\rightarrow$ `Milling` $\rightarrow$ `Ceramic` $\rightarrow$ `Quality Control` $\rightarrow$ `Delivered`.
- **Validation:** A case cannot move to "Delivered" if financial requirements aren't met or if mandatory steps are skipped.

### 2. Automated Financial Engine

Dental technicians are often paid via complex commission structures (e.g., _Technician A gets 15% of the ceramic work, Technician B gets fixed rate per unit_).
Oscar automates this entirely.

- **Payroll Reports:** Generates detailed salary slips instantly based on completed units.
- **Debt Tracking:** Tracks dentist payments and outstanding balances with visual alerts.

### 3. Analytics Dashboard

Integrated **LiveCharts2** to visualize lab performance:

- Monthly Revenue vs. Expenses.
- Case volume per Dentist (identifying top clients).
- Technician efficiency ratings.

## Technical Highlight: Serverless Licensing System

Since this is **proprietary commercial software**, I needed a robust way to handle license keys without maintaining a dedicated auth server.

I engineered a creative solution using the **GitHub API** as a backend:

1.  **Request:** When a user installs Oscar, it generates a unique hardware fingerprint.
2.  **Issue Tracking:** The app programmatically creates a "License Request" issue in a private GitHub repository via `Octokit.net`.
3.  **Verification:** Once I approve the issue (add a specific label or comment), the application detects the status change on its next poll.
4.  **Activation:** The app unlocks.

This architecture meant **zero server costs** and **zero maintenance** for the licensing infrastructure while leveraging GitHub's enterprise-grade security.

```csharp
// Simplified Logic of the Activation Check
public async Task<bool> CheckLicenseStatus(string hardwareId)
{
    var github = new GitHubClient(new ProductHeaderValue("OscarLab"));
    // Queries private repo issues for the hardware ID tag
    var issue = await github.Issue.GetAllForRepository("Oscar_Auth", new RepositoryIssueRequest {
        Filter = IssueFilter.All,
        Labels = { "approved", hardwareId }
    });

    return issue.Count > 0;
}
```

## Deployment & Updates

Desktop apps are notoriously hard to keep updated. Oscar solves this using **AutoUpdater.NET**.

- The app checks an XML file hosted on a public GitHub repo on startup.
- If a new version exists, it downloads the installer, runs it, and migrates the SQLite database schema automatically using EF Core Migrations.

## Conclusion

Oscar is more than a database; it is an operating system for dental labs. By combining the raw performance of C# with modern architectural patterns, it turned a fragile paper process into a resilient digital workflow.
