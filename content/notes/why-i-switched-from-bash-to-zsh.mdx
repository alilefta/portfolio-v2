While Bash is the standard, Zsh (Z Shell) significantly boosts command-line productivity, especially when paired with frameworks like Oh My Zsh. It's often worth the switch for any serious developer.

Key Reasons for the Switch:

Smarter Autocompletion: Tab completion is incredibly powerful. It can autocomplete command arguments, git branches, file paths (even in the middle of a word), and context-aware options.

Syntax Highlighting: Commands turn green if they are valid before you even hit enter, catching typos instantly.

Powerful History: `cd` followed by a quick tab lets you jump to recent directories.

Theming: Oh My Zsh provides hundreds of themes and plugins for customizing the look and functionality (like showing current Git status in the prompt).
