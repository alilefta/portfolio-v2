Tailwind's built-in `truncate` utility only supports single-line truncation. To achieve exactly two (or N) lines of text truncation, you need to use the @tailwindcss/line-clamp plugin.

Install the plugin: `npm install @tailwindcss/line-clamp`

Add it to tailwind.config.js:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/line-clamp")],
};
```

Use the `line-clamp-2` utility in your HTML:

```html
<p class="line-clamp-2 text-gray-700">
  This text will automatically truncate after the second line with an ellipsis,
  ensuring a clean, consistent UI even with variable content lengths.
</p>
```
